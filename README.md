# Eviction Litigation Study
An investigation of New York City evictions and litigations in 2017.

For this project, I investigated the distribution of evictions and 
litigations in New York City and the correlation between evictions and non-white
populations, as well as litigations and non-white populations. I found a strong positive correlation between evictions and non-white populations,
and a strong positive correlation between litigations and non-white populations.
